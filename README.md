# rtCamp

Respected rtCamp hiring team,
I am applying with this email because using my main email id I am not able to apply. I was try to contact rtCamp support team but I did not get any response.
**My Main Git Hub Profile:** https://github.com/kiran1643 (all projects are uploaded here.) Please consider my application. <br /> <br />
I am very interested in this role.
My parent's annual income is around 108000. From that they pay the rent 24000, which means only 84000 rupees they have annually. I am living in Pune for my education. My room rent, and mess expenses are around 5-6 thousand per month. My parents annual income is 84K and my college fee is also 83845. Still, I am pursuing my education, from this you can get an idea of how hardworking and confident I am about my decisions. I just want to tell you please give me one chance because this is my dream company due to two reasons: 1) My parents are getting old and from my diploma I am living in a hostel so they want to live with me and I also want to live with them so I can take care of them. Our organization is giving me this opportunity because I can work from anywhere. 
2) The Tech Stack on which organization work is my favourite. So I love working on it.

So please give one opportunity to work with rtCamp.
